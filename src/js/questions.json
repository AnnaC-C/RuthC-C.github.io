    "tips": "In this case the y values are the same but the tan graph has been 'squashed' in the x direction. To find the scale factor, we need to look at the period of the graph. Usually the tan graph has a period of 180째, but here it is 60째. Therefore the scale factor is 1/3 and the equation is: y = tan3x."
